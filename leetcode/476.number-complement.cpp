 * Testcase Example:  '5'
 *
 * Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement
 * strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed
 * integer.
 * You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary
 * representation.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: 5
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits),
 * and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: 1
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and
 * its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
