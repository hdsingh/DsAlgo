 * 
 * In LeetCode Store, there are some kinds of items to sell. Each item has a
 * price.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * However, there are some special offers, and a special offer consists of one
 * or more different kinds of items with a sale price.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * You are given the each item's price, a set of special offers, and the number
 * we need to buy for each item.
 * The job is to output the lowest price you have to pay for exactly certain
 * items as given, where you could make optimal use of the special offers.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Each special offer is represented in the form of an array, the last number
 * represents the price you need to pay for this special offer, other numbers
 * represents how many specific items you could get if you buy this offer.
 * 
 * 
 * You could use any of special offers as many times as you want.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: [2,5], [[3,0,5],[1,2,10]], [3,2]
 * Output: 14
 * Explanation: 
 * There are two kinds of items, A and B. Their prices are $2 and $5
 * respectively. 
 * In special offer 1, you can pay $5 for 3A and 0B
 * In special offer 2, you can pay $10 for 1A and 2B. 
 * You need to buy 3A and 2B, so you may pay $10 for 1A and 2B (special offer
 * #2), and $4 for 2A.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: [2,3,4], [[1,1,0,4],[2,2,1,9]], [1,2,1]
 * Output: 11
 * Explanation: 
 * The price of A is $2, and $3 for B, $4 for C. 
 * You may pay $4 for 1A and 1B, and $9 for 2A ,2B and 1C. 
 * You need to buy 1A ,2B and 1C, so you may pay $4 for 1A and 1B (special
 * offer #1), and $3 for 1B, $4 for 1C. 
 * You cannot add more items, though only $9 for 2A ,2B and 1C.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * There are at most 6 kinds of items, 100 special offers.
 * For each item, you need to buy at most 6 of them.
 * You are not allowed to buy more items than you want, even if that would
 * lower the overall price.
